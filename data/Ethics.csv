ai_ethical_considerations





openess

Point of truth
Not loosing the necessary relevant human aspects of its organisation, market and ecosystem at large (ie compassion, intuition, humor, etc)
Accuracy 

Security and reliability
Reliability and Stability

Implications, Common sense, and how to revert AI actions/rules as AI wouldnt assume its actions were wrong
trust
Security, Privacy
Ensure that the systems are not biased
Reduction of fear that AI will cause people to lose jobs

A traceable way to document the decision made by the application

Protection of private information where applicable
Developer biases not reflect in application outcomes

neutral
"AI is not neutral, it makes ""decisions"" based on what a programmer's bias are"
unbiased, critical thinking skills
There should be a humane angle in this if at all possible.  

Responsible development, factoring Risk. 
Motive (a reason for implementing such a system)
Voluntary participation
Environmental
Trust

Integrity
dependable 
There are unique considerations specific to an organization's target market and growth strategy that will influence their AI applications - karen
willingness


Security

Cannot integrate peoples personal information - needs to stay focused on business

The option to overrule the AI result and then afterwards to provide feedback
Management/visibility of individual's identity.


"Firstly, the logic in these systems are what gives it its competitive advantage, so having traceability here could be tricky. One needs to then ask the question: is it ethical to make a profit off someone else? That is what capitalism is all about, so to say ""it's unfair"" would be juvinile."






sustainability, workforce impact, sometimes the truth is too much and we need to make decisions based on experience or politics, thus my AI systems shows we need to alter product offering to something my company feels does not match our company values or people culture, in this case we should not accept the change. e.g. lets include in maps on our cars quickest access to closest bar. 
Consideration for Jobs, Human elements in an Organizations. No organization can exists without humans. Without Consumers / customers, there cannot be an organization.


trust
?

Understanding. 



Protection of information for BMW










Ensure that personal data is secure and not accessible outside of the organisation

Depending on the type of business, the AI application should not be only process, it should handle 99% of the process, but you should always have an review process / escalation process that could override the AI. I do not know if AI will ever replace an experts intuition. 

repeatability and accuracy 
No
 non-victimising
It should be discussed in a diverse group, to teach AI, which ethics should be considered. Ethics can only be determined through a groups decision.

Have full transparency on the stakeholders responsible in developing the AI system to ensure that none were emotional enough to add their bias opinions on the dataset and AI algorithm.
can this data be easily made harmful, ie dont repeat IBM mistakes of 1930s, or modern day Facebook
Reliability

Psychological considerations
That the input data sets used to train the AI is itself fair.
AI is here to stay, one day AI will be way ahead of us. Strong trust and rules, accountabilities and safeguards will be utmost importance. But there will be AI that is uncontrolled. Think China, Russia
Security
Not sure



Recognition 



bias


Support, cant trust something, when there are complexities and something unknows. If an error occurs, and there are no support on the topic. Then one just throw the idea in the dustbin and move onto the next one
privacy


No idea, IA is still a very complex
Usage of historical data must time-boxed properly and sanitised to avoid coded biases


secure
-----
Security and Context

Source data for training AI algorithms should be bias free.
Humans still able to take control whenever required.
AI is imperfect  AI Bias  Can AI become rogue?



Protect end-users  Avoid third-party beneficiaries of the system
privacy
Nothing to add.

confidentiality 

data should not be modified, the truth from the source is important, otherwise no value


Sounds good
not to be bias

Environmental and health impact on its users
