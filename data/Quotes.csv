BPM research focuses on analytical and computational approaches to generate design artefacts such as frameworks, methods or technology that support the execution and management of processes in organisations. In this way, BPM largely follows prescriptive research objectives that relate to the question how a process can be improved.

To address this research question in a more ﬁnegrained fashion, we use the Resource-Based View (RBV) of the ﬁrm (Wernerfelt, 1984) as the underlying theoretical lens to identify the relevant BDA resources, and contingency theory to examine how contextual factors coalesce with the resources to drive incremental and radical process innovation capabilities. Building on a sample of 202 survey responses from IT managers in Norwegian ﬁrms, we employ

a conﬁgurational approach and examine the patterns of elements that lead to high levels of incremental and radical process innovation capabilities. This is done through the methodological tool fsQCA, which facilitates a more nuanced view of the non-linear relationships between BDA resources, contextual factors, and their eﬀect on process innovation capabilities.

Particularly, the dynamism, heterogeneity, and hostility of the environment are critical to consider, since under such condition's organisations need to reconﬁgure the way they operate and emphasise more on analytical and research capabilities. The impact of the environment, and particularly the dynamism and competition within the market, the rate of technological change, and the scarcity of key resources have been noted to signiﬁcantly aﬀect the types of resources that are important in business process management (Vom Brocke  Mendling, 2018).

We then present our proposed approach for representing such data. We continue by describing the design of two inde­ pendent experiments – with different sample pools – comparing an instance-based data representation with a traditional class-based (relational) representation. The first experiment focuses on content consumers' ability to

explore a large dataset and identify patterns in it. The second experiment studies the correctness of query­ ing steps in closed-ended tasks. The two experiments show that instance-based data can lead to better perfor­ mance and understanding of phenomena. We conclude by discussing the implications of our work as well as its limitations, and opportunities for future research.

Specifically, we view classification schemes as heuristics that help users under­ stand a specific view of data and serve as a starting point in the process of solving a problem. These starting points serve as anchors that can lead to cognitive biases (Tversky  Kahneman, 1974).

Classes reflect a repeat ing pattern of attributes and indicate that relationships might exist between the attributes (Parsons  Wand, 2008a). Thus, classes represent similarity of phenomena and make it possible to infer additional attributes of inst ances (Parsons  Wand, 2008a). By enabling inferences, classes provide utility (Parsons  Wand, 2000, p. 238). From this perspective, classification structure is not inher ent in the real world but is a human activity that provides useful abstractions of similarities among things that sup­ port reasoning and action. Consequently, rather than rely ing on a database designer to construct the “correct” classi fication structure, content consumers should have the option to create their required classes on demand, as there might be many ways of classifying a given set of inst ances (Parsons  Wand, 2000).

RDF provides a way to describe the relationship between information resources in the form of triples: subjects that have proper­ ties with certain values (Klyne  Carroll, 2006). RDF syntax reflects a simple graph-based data model (Klyne  Carroll, 2006). We use a similar approach to represent instance-based data. The instance-based model treats an instance as a symbol designating the perceived existence of “a material object, action, event, or any other phenom­ enon” (Parsons  Wand, 2008b, p. 842). We talk about instances in terms of their properties, which constitute statements about instance characteristics (Parsons  Wand, 2008b). Properties can belong to an instance alone (intrinsic properties) or be shared between two or more instances (mutual properties). To model informa­ tion in a manner consistent with instance-based princip les,3 we use a representation in which an instance in the domain is represented as a node. Intrinsic properties are grouped together and depicted on top of the node object. If two instances share one or more mutual properties, they are connected by arcs labelled with the mutual properties' names.
